# Kenwood TM-D710GA
Restoring DTMF decode capabilities for remote control cross-band repeater.

Manuals in these newer radios have notes about wireless operation being unavailable in serials B8610081 and up for the V71A and B8610001 and up for the 710GA.


I have an old Alinco HT DJ-V5 after looking at the service manual I noticed that it has the ic (dtmf decoder) I desoldered the ic and took the chance to solder it in my Kenwood TM-D710G rig, the result is conclusive the menu 923 and 924 is appeared as if by magic, I put the radio in remote mode (REV + POWER ON).

YES YES YES !!!! Good News it working !!!
