Restoring DTMF decode capabilities


Good news...

I have an old Alinco HT DJ-V5 after looking at the service manual I noticed that it has the ic (dtmf decoder) I desoldered the ic and took the chance to solder it in my Kenwood TM-D710G rig, the result is conclusive the menu 923 and 924 is appeared as if by magic, I put the radio in remote mode (REV + POWER ON).
